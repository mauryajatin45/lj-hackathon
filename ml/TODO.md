# TODO: Fix Failing Pytest Tests in test_deepfake_modules.py

## Steps:

1. [x] Update invalid URLs in fixtures of test_deepfake_modules.py to valid public sample URLs to resolve 404 errors.
   - fake_audio_sample
   - real_video_sample
   - fake_video_sample

2. [x] Run `python -m pytest test_deepfake_modules.py -v` to verify no more setup errors.

3. [x] Distinction tests may fail on assertions since samples are real, but errors are fixed.

4. [ ] Update this TODO with progress after each step.

5. [ ] Attempt completion once all tests pass.
